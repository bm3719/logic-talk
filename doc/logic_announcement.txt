Logic Programming in Clojure

Let's disable our emotion chips and be entirely logical for an evening.  In
this presentation, we'll explore the foundations of the logic programming
paradigm and demonstrate its expression in Clojure using David Nolen's
core.logic, an implementation of the miniKanren eDSL.

Logic programming is uniquely suited as an approach for several diverse classes
of problems that may otherwise seem effectively intractable.  After this
meetup, you'll be able to recognize those situations and confident enough to
leverage the power of formal logic in your designs.  One can also never be too
logical, and you can apply these notions to everyday life as well.

As usual, we'll attempt to keep this talk of reasonable length to give plenty
of time for attendees to exchange logical proofs and, if people insist, ad-hoc
interaction.  Humans are welcome to attend, but all talking must be in an
emotionless, robotic monotone.

Edible biomatter and fluidic lubrication will be provided by Whiteboard
Federal.  Activate a distress beacon via Bruce's communicator if there are any
issues locating the venue or entering the facility.
