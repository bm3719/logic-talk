Lorem ipsum

"The contrast between function and procedure is a reflection of the general
distinction between describing properties of things and describing how to do
things, or, as it is sometimes referred to, the distinction between declarative
knowledge and imperative knowledge. In mathematics we are usually concerned
with declarative (what is) descriptions, whereas in computer science we are
usually concerned with imperative (how to) descriptions."
