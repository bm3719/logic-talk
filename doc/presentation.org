Logic Programming:
- Introduction, motivations, context
- Basics of formal logic
- Logic expressed in Prolog
- Embedding logic programming in Clojure using core.logic

* Why Logic Programming?

Lorem ipsum

"The contrast between function and procedure is a reflection of the general
distinction between describing properties of things and describing how to do
things, or, as it is sometimes referred to, the distinction between declarative
knowledge and imperative knowledge. In mathematics we are usually concerned
with declarative (what is) descriptions, whereas in computer science we are
usually concerned with imperative (how to) descriptions." - SICP §1.1.7

* Formal Logic

Problem solving

Knowledge representation: Logic programs as databases

* Logic Programming

                    [[./logic_1.png]]

Often about search in the form of searching a solution space, often tree-based,
for one or more valid solutions to a problem.

Logic Engines

* Prolog

Lorem ipsum

* core.logic

                    [[./logic_2.png]]

core.logic is a logic programming eDSL for Clojure.

  Based on miniKanren (and derivatives) by William Byrd, Dan Friedman, et al..
