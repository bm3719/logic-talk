* logic-talk

This is a demonstration project that will be used to illustrate a few
introductory formal logic concepts in Clojure.  It consists of a
presentation and some code, both in Prolog and in Clojure.  In the latter,
core.logic is used.

These concepts will be presented at the National Capital Area Clojure Users
Group on 2017-04-12 (maybe).  See the [[https://www.meetup.com/Cap-Clug/events/vvnjlmywgbqb/][event page]] for details.

* Usage

The Prolog code is contained in a single file, logic.pl, located in the root
project directory.

The Clojure part of this application is only intended to be used from the REPL.
To run the application and connect to the REPL:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
lein repl :headless
#+END_SRC

There is also an presentation in org-mode (to be used with org-present) in the
doc/ directory.
